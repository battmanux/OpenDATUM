# Introduction
First off, thank you for considering contributing to OpenDATUM. It's people like you that will make it a great success.
You may want to make the world a better place using analitics and open data, or just quickly fix a bug in a tool you use in your daily job.
In any case you are welcome as a contributor to this project.

Working together is hard. This project is merging concerns from people that have complementary expertises, native tongue and culture.
This is prone to conflictual interaction, however we experienced that it is possible and that when it works 
it generates innovation and many other positive benefits. 

This is why we encourage you to read, follow and comment this CONTRIBUTING.md notice.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions or textual feature request.
In a general way, if you have an idea of what should be different in the project, try to code a working prototype of it in your branch and
we will help you fit the project architectural structure and rules in order to simplify the pull request acceptance.

# Ground Rules
- Messages, documentation, variables names and comments are written in english
- Never point out that someone else did wrong. Always show a way that could benefit to all.
- Show respect for the code of others as you expect respect for yours
- Show respect for your own code otherwise I will never merge it in the master branch.

# Your First Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to OpenDATUM? As the project is pretty new we recomend that you try to get in touch with
someone already involved in it. We will see how your expertise and time can be better integrated in our common effort.

# Getting started
Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors or where the content is small and localized enough to ensure zero regression 
in functionalities can be submitted by a contributor as a patch. Otherwise...

So you want to do it! Great, this is how we suggest you do it:

 - Create your own fork of the code
 - Do the changes in your fork
 - Build the reference docker image and run it
 - Navigate into reference test projects to see how you code behaves
 - Run unit test and check that there is no degradation in results
 
If you like the change and think the project could use it:
 - Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
 - Read again the CONTRIBUTING.md guide
 - Send a pull request

# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@opendatum.net instead. 
However keep in mind that this project is ment to run in a trusted environment where there is low security risks. 
Please notify explicitly in the email what can be done from outside of the trusted environement (local network) such as:
- send unpublushed data to external network agent
- give unexpected execution control to external network agent
- [other] to external network agent

If you find a bug, just fix it for now. We will see later when the project have may useres that are not involved in project developement.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
We are brainstorming on features once a week. If you feel that you have time to defend your ideas in that kind of event, get in touch with me 

# Coding Style
- Make it readable. 
- Use meaningfull names. 
- Avoid generic names. 
- Use Systems Hungarian notations. 
- Check indentation with formatR.

# Code review process
The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout.
The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are recorded in the wiki. 
Notes are written in the project wiki and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout. 
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. 
After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
We start with a community where people have a chance to meet oneanother.
If you with to contribute and discovered this project without knowing any of us, WOW! our project is successful! Try to let us know using the wiki and we will see how to integrate you.
