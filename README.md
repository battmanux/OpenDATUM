# OpenDATUM
Open source data platform for data scientists

## Purpose
OpenDATUM provides a light data platform allowing data scientists to directly navigate in datalakes.
Datawarehouse and Datamarts are implicitly constructed and updated while navigating and exploring data sources.

## Curent Status
We are at the beginning of the project. For know I can list the workload commitment we gathered:
 - Myself: 800h of work on this project from April 2017 to April 2018.
 - You?: ...

## History
Data preparation easaly represents 75% of the time spent by datascientists while constructing an analysis. This part of the work is repetitive and hard to convert into "production ready" algorithms. We believe that a good part of it can be accelerated with an appropriated data platform. 
We believe that such a project shall be fully open source and managed as a community project.
